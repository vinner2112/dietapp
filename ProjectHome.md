The android application will allow a user to enter a target weight within a target time.  The app will calculate the calorie deficit required per day to achieve this goal and display it for the user.  The user may keep track of how many calories they consume (through barcode scanning or manual entering) and how many calories they burn (through predefined exercise options or manual entering).  The app will keep a log of the users calorie information for each day and store it, to be viewed at the user's convenience.
